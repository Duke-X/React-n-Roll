## COURSE SELLING APP BACKEND - created user panel, admin panel, course panel

- Either we can use config.js here, to store the important keys in a single place, but this file will might be visible to the world on github

- Or we can use .env file to store the keys, and put this in .gitignore which will hide the file and it won't be visible to the world on github

- There's one more file .env.example which is used to showcase the keys that are stored but only the var name, not the values.
